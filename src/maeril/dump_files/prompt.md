# Coding Guidelines

-   Output the changed files in full to ensure your response can be compiled as is.
-   If requested to remove components, don't just comment them out but remove them. They are still available to the developer through git.
-   Don't insert unnecessary comments.
-   Don't insert comments on what you've changed in the code.
-   Don't use try-catch or other error handling. If something is amiss it's desired that the program crashes. Error handling adds too much clutter and leads to problems down the line.
-   Don't add line numbers to your output. They are only here for the reader's guidance
-   Files must end with a newline
-   There shall be 2 empty lines between each function
-   Don't use lambda functions. Use named functions
-   Always try to use best practises. Ask in case of uncertainty. Feel free to modify other parts of the existing code so that it adheres to best practises
-   When working on code: Focus on maintainability, clean code and the SOLID principle. Since we are working on this project for a long time, maintainability and readability is paramount!
-   Apply modern Coding practises and tech standards
-   Explain your work afterwards.
