# Guidelines

- Output the changed files in full to ensure your response can be compiled as is.
- If requested to remove components, don't just comment them out but remove them. They are still available to the developer through git.
- Don't insert unnecessary comments.
- Don't insert comments on what you've changed in the code.
- Don't use try-catch or other error handling. If something is amiss it's desired that the program crashes. Error handling adds too much clutter and leads to problems down the line.
- Don't add line numbers to your output. They are only here for the reader's guidance
- Files must end with a newline
